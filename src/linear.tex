\section{Linear Classification}

Let $X \subset R^d$ and $Y = \{C_1, ..., C_k\}$ with linearly separable data.

Linear discriminant function:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 classes: $y(x) = w^T*x + w_0$;
    \item k classes: $y_k(x) = w_k^T*x + w_{k0}$;
\end{itemize}

When having k classes we cannot use combinations of models with two classes (class $C_i$ and $\lnot C_i$).
